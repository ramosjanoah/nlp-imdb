("A film about a Stephen King story? Directed by Frank Darabont.  .  .  Who?  
 Starring Tim Robbins.  .  .  Wasn't he the guy from Howard the Duck?  
 I admit, only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie.  
 Now the only questions I have to ask are:  Why didn't EVERYBODY go to see this movie?  and, Why didn't Morgan Freeman win the Oscar?  
 Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan.  
 Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus'.  
 Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and, Mr Darabont take a bow.  
 Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but, 
 I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach.  .  .  Perfect.",

above ten classics have never been released on video and ALL OFTHEM have a 
rating far greater than Gigli. Gigli is a classic example
of the idiotic marketing practices that go on. 
Gigli is available onvideo, simply because the ignorant masses are not 
told about the greatfilms of the past which are far superior, but neglected. 
Only the oneswho prefer to "go beyond the box" can appreciate great cinema 
that ispractically non-existent in today\'s movies.', '1/10')
